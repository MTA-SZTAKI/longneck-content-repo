longneck-content-repo
=====================

The content repository contains Longneck transformation rule sets for common data integration problems. 
The main strength of Longneck are modular and flexible data processing descriptions: reusable blocks, entities and processes enable fast data integration process implementation with fewer errors.
These are organized here according to business domain and localization, and can be used to start a new application.

The directory path of entites and blocks consists of the following elements:

<code>
/[domain/subdomain]/[language_code|country_code]/NAME.[language_code|country_code].[block|entity].xml
</code>

Directories contain a README.md file with the documentation of the given transformation rules, so feel free to browse the repo on GitHub.

See the [Longneck website](http://longneck.sztaki.hu/guides#content-repo) for more details.
